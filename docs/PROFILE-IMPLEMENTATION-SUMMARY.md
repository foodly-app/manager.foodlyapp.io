## 2. Routing Architecture Fixed ✅

### Problem Identified:
- Laravel had routes for `/dashboard`, `/`, etc.
- Vue Router also used same paths
- Conflict between server-side and client-side routing
- Page refresh would fail on SPA routes

### Solution Implemented:

#### A. Laravel Routes (`routes/web.php`)

**Before:**
```php
Route::get('/', function () { return view('welcome'); });
Route::get('/login', function () { return view('login'); });
Route::get('/dashboard', function () { return view('dashboard'); });
```

**After:**
```php
// Login page (standalone)
Route::get('/login', function () { return view('login'); });

// SPA Catch-all route
Route::get('/{any}', function () {
    return view('dashboard');
})->where('any', '^(?!api|auth|test-connection|organizations).*$')
  ->middleware('partner.auth')
  ->name('spa');
```

**Key Changes:**
- Removed `/` and `/dashboard` routes
- Added catch-all `/{any}` route
- Excludes API routes from catch-all
- Protected by `partner.auth` middleware
- Returns dashboard view for all SPA routes

#### B. Vue Router (`resources/js/router/index.js`)

**Added Routes:**
- `/profile` - User profile page

**Added Features:**
- 404 fallback (redirects to dashboard)
- Meta field: `requiresAuth: true` on all routes
- Page title updates on navigation

**Routes:**
```
/              → Dashboard
/bookings      → Bookings
/tables        → Tables
/menu          → Menu
/profile       → Profile (NEW)
/settings      → Settings
/*             → Redirect to /
```

## 3. Internationalization (i18n) ✅

### Files Updated:
- `resources/js/locales/ka.json` (Georgian)
- `resources/js/locales/en.json` (English)

### New Translation Keys Added:

#### Common:
- `common.name` - "სახელი" / "Name"
- `common.phone` - "ტელეფონი" / "Phone"
- `common.language` - "ენა" / "Language"

#### Profile Section:
```json
{
  "profile": {
    "title": "ჩემი პროფილი" / "My Profile",
    "subtitle": "...",
    "personalInfo": "...",
    "accountDetails": "...",
    "security": "...",
    "changePassword": "...",
    "currentPassword": "...",
    "newPassword": "...",
    "confirmPassword": "...",
    "deleteAvatar": "...",
    "avatarUploadSuccess": "...",
    "passwordChangeSuccess": "..."
  }
}
```

#### Validation:
```json
{
  "validation": {
    "required": "...",
    "minLength": "...",
    "passwordMismatch": "..."
  }
}
```

## 4. Navigation Updates ✅

### AppLayout Sidebar
**File:** `resources/js/components/AppLayout.vue`

**Added:**
- Profile link in sidebar navigation
- User icon click navigates to /profile

**Before:**
```html
<router-link to="/tables">...</router-link>
<router-link to="/settings">...</router-link>
```

**After:**
```html
<router-link to="/tables">...</router-link>
<router-link to="/profile">...</router-link>
<router-link to="/settings">...</router-link>
```

### Header User Button
**Before:**
```html
<Button icon="pi pi-user" ... />
```

**After:**
```html
<Button icon="pi pi-user" @click="router.push('/profile')" ... />
```

### Page Title
Added profile title to computed property:
```javascript
const pageTitle = computed(() => {
    const titles = {
        'profile': t('common.profile'), // NEW
        ...
    };
});
```
